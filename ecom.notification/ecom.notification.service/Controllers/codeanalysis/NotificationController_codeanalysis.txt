Positive Points: 
1. The code is well organized and easy to read. 
2. Dependency injection is used in the constructor. 
3. The logger is used to log errors and other information. 

Improvement Areas: 
1. The controller should be more strongly typed with a view model instead of using an Order object. 
2. A try/catch block should be added to the Submit method to handle any exceptions that may occur while sending the notification. 
3. Unit tests should be added to test the functionality of the Submit method.
