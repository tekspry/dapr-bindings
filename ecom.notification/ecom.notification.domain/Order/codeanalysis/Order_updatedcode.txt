The code review for the above code is as follows:

1. The code does not have any syntax errors and is well-structured. 
2. The data types of properties are correct and appropriate. 
3. The code should be made more robust by removing the '?' from the data type of properties, as they are not nullable. 
4. The code should be optimized by adding comments to explain the purpose of the code and its functionality.
