// Positive Points 
1. The code is well organized and easy to understand. 
2. The enum values are clear and descriptive. 

// Improvement Areas 
1. The constant values should be named using PascalCase (e.g. OrderPlaced -> OrderPlaced). 
2. It would be more descriptive to use the full name of the order state in the enum values (e.g. OrderPlaced -> PlacedOrder).
