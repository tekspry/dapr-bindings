// Positive Points
The code is well-structured and easy to read. The use of the ? operator after the Id and Address properties indicates that they are nullable, which is a good practice. The Name and Email properties are initialized with an empty string, which is a good practice to prevent null reference exceptions. 

// Improvement Areas
The ContactNumber property should also be nullable, as not all customers may have a contact number. Additionally, the Name and Email properties should have a maximum length to prevent users from entering too long of values.
