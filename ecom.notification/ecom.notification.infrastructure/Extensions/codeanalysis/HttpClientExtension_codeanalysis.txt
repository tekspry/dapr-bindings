Code Review:  
Positive Points: 
1. The code is using the .Net HttpClient library which is the recommended way of making HTTP requests in .Net applications. 
2. The code is using the System.Text.Json library to serialize and deserialize JSON data. 
3. The code is using the MediaTypeHeaderValue class to set the Content-Type header of the request. 
4. The code is using the IsSuccessStatusCode property to check if the response was successful and throw an exception if not. 

Improvement Areas: 
1. The code could be improved by using the HttpRequestMessage class to create the request instead of using the StringContent class. 
2. The code could be improved by using the HttpResponseMessage class to read the response instead of using the ReadAsStringAsync method. 
3. The code could be improved by using a more descriptive name for the ReadContentAs method to make it clear what it does.
