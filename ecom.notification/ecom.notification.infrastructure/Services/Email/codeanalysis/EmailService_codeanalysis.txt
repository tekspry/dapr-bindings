Code Review: 
Positive Points: 
- The code is well structured and organized, making it easy to read and understand. 
- Variables are well named and the code is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- Good use of logging. 
- Appropriate use of try/catch blocks. 

Improvement Areas: 
- The method should be async, as it is making an asynchronous call. 
- The body variable could be split into multiple lines for better readability. 
- The metadata variable could be refactored to use an object instead of a dictionary.
