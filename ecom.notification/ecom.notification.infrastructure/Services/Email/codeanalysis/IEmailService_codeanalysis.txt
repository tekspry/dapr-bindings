Positive Points: 
- The code is well organized and clearly namespaced. 
- IEmailService interface is defined to send emails. 
- The SendEmail method is defined to accept OrderForNotfication as a parameter. 
 
Improvement Areas: 
- The interface could be more generic and accept any type of Notification object rather than OrderForNotfication. 
- The SendEmail method could be more descriptive and provide more information about what it does. 
- The interface could be split up into multiple interfaces to better organize the code and make it more maintainable.
