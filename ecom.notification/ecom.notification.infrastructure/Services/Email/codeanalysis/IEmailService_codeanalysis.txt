Positive Points:
- The code follows a consistent naming convention and is easy to read.
- The code is well organized and logically structured.
- The interface is clearly defined and provides a clear indication of the purpose of the class.

Improvement Areas:
- The interface should be more strongly typed and should include parameters for the email address, subject, body and attachments.
- More input validation should be included to ensure that valid data is being passed in.
- The code should be refactored to make it more modular and easier to maintain.
