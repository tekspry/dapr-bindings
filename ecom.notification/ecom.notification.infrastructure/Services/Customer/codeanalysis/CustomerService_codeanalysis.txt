Code Review:

Positive Points: 
- This code makes use of the HttpClient class to make HTTP requests, which is the recommended approach for making HTTP requests in .NET applications.
- The ReadContentAs() extension method is used to deserialize the response into a CustomerDetails object.

Improvement Areas: 
- The code could be improved by adding additional checks to ensure that the response is valid before deserializing it.
- The code could be improved by adding additional logging to log the response and any errors that may occur during the request.
