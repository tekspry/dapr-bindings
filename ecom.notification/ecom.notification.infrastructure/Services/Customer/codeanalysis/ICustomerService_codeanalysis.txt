Positive Points: 
1. The code is well structured and organized. 
2. The interface is clearly defined and named appropriately. 
3. The method is named clearly and the parameters are well defined. 

Improvement Areas: 
1. The interface could be made more generic by allowing for different types of customer identifiers (e.g. email, phone, etc.). 
2. The method could be made more flexible by allowing for additional parameters to be passed in such as language preference or location. 
3. The method could be improved by adding more error handling and logging to help debug any issues that may arise.
