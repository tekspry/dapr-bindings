Positive Points:
1. The code is using the Dependency Injection pattern, which is a good practice for writing maintainable code. 
2. The code is using the HttpClient class to make API calls, which is a good practice for making API calls. 
3. The code is using the ReadContentAs<T>() extension method to deserialize the response object into a domain object, which is a good practice for deserializing objects. 

Improvement Areas:
1. The code could be improved by adding error handling around the API call.
2. The code could be improved by adding logging to track the API calls and errors. 
3. The code could be improved by adding unit tests to ensure that the API calls are working as expected.
