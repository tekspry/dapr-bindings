Positive Points: 
1. The code is well organized and easy to read. 
2. The interface is named appropriately and follows the naming conventions. 
3. The interface is named with the suffix "Service", which implies that it is a service. 
 
Improvement Areas: 
1. The method should be marked with the async keyword to indicate that it is an asynchronous method. 
2. The method should have more descriptive parameters, such as productId instead of just id.
